### Project 1: 
#### Radar chart or spider chart in Python using pandas, plotly and go.Scatterpolar
In this video, I show how to create a radar chart or spidar chart in Python using pandas, plotly and go.Scatterpolar. I show two cases; single trace and a chart with three traces (for the three items we have). 

We put a legend and a title by fig.update_layout and style the chart by fig.update_polars. I have used gridshape, angularaxis_tickfont, radialaxis_range, radialaxis_dtick and radialaxis_showticklabels to make it look the way I want. 

Hope you find it useful.
