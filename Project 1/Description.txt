I have shown how to create a radar chart or spidar chart in Python using pandas, plotly and go.Scatterpolar. I present two cases here; a chart with one trace and one with three traces. I...

1) put a legend and a title using fig.update_layout, 
2) created a polygon radar chart using a linear gridshape, 
3) styled the angular axis by angularaxis_tickfont, 
4) styled the radial axis by radialaxis_range, radialaxis_dtick and radialaxis_showticklabels.
