In this video, I show how to create multiple radar charts or spidar charts in one figure in Python using pandas, subplots in plotly and go.Scatterpolar. 

I present two cases here; a figure with three radar charts in a row and a figure with 15 radar charts (5 rows and 3 columns). To create them, I 

i) used make_subplots with desired rows and columns - at each location a radar chart will be placed, 
ii) created a polygon radar chart using a linear gridshape, 
ii) used angularaxis_tickfont, radialaxis_range, radialaxis_dtick and radialaxis_showticklabels to have the desired style, and 
iii) put a title using fig.update_layout and style the chart by fig.update_polars. To put a title for each subplot, fid.update_annotations were used as the title for each subplot is called annotation. 

Hope you find it useful.
