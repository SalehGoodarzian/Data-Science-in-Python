In this video, I show how to create a radar chart or spidar chart in Python using pandas, plotly and go.Scatterpolar. I present two cases here; a chart with one trace and one with three traces. I...

1) created a polygon radar chart using a linear gridshape, 
2) used angularaxis_tickfont, radialaxis_range, radialaxis_dtick and radialaxis_showticklabels to have the desired style,  
3) put a legend and a title using fig.update_layout and style the chart by fig.update_polars, 

Hope you find it useful.
