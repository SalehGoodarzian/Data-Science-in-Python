I show how to create radar charts or spidar charts with "multiple scales on multiple axes" in Python using matplotlib. 

Matplotlib allows us to print only one set of radial grids on only one radius. But, we need a specific set of radial grids on each radius or spike. Here, we use ax.text() to print the radial grid values as "text" on each radius.
