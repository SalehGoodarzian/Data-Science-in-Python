I show how to create radar charts or spidar charts in in Python using matplotlib. 

I present three cases here; a figure with one trace attached to a radar chart, a figure with three traces attached to a radar charts and a figure with three subplots (each containing one trace). 

fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'}, dpi=150) 
allows us to create a figure with polar projection

ax.set_thetagrids and ax.set_rmax
allow us to modify the figure

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, subplot_kw={'projection': 'polar'}, gridspec_kw={'wspace': 0.5}, dpi=150)
allows us to create a figure with three subplots in a row with polar projection
