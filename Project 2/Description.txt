I show how to create multiple radar charts or spidar charts in one figure in Python using pandas, make_subplots in plotly and go.Scatterpolar. 

I present two cases here; a figure with three radar charts in a row and a figure with 15 radar charts (5 rows and 3 columns). I 

i) used make_subplots to create a lay-out with desired number of rows and columns, 
ii) used go.Scatterpolar to add traces to the figure at their right places, 
iii) used update_annotations to edit the subplots' titles, 
iv) put a title using fig.update_layout, 
v) created a polygon radar chart using a linear gridshape, 
vi) used update_polars to style angular and radial axes features 
vii) used tickvals and ticktext to replace numbers with words

Hope you find it useful.
